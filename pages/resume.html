            Summary
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am a ruby/rails specialist that thrives on providing elegant solutions to complex problems based on a love for efficiency, working
            smarter, and seeing positive results. I am a very strong believer in using idiomatic coding conventions in a test driven development
            process because it helps small teams understand peer code and remain agile. I take ownership of projects, have a strong work ethic, and
            require no hand holding.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Highlights of Qualifications
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>PROGRAMMING SKILLS:</strong> Ruby, JavaScript, and XHTML/CSS. I am incredibly proficient in Ruby and have collaborated on quite a
            few open source projects. To date, I have been programming web applications using Ruby and JavaScript professionally for more than 3
            years. My XHTML/CSS skills far exceed most programmers since I have been developing web sites for more than 10 years and have been doing
            compliant presentation layer XHTML for more than 6 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>WEB APPLICATION EXPERIENCE:</strong> Ruby and especially the Rails framework is my love and focus. I have been working in Rails
            since before its version was 1.0 and migrations were a reality. Unlike a lot of other programmers, I know the Rails framework inside and
            out and I specialize in ActiveRecord extensions in both the abstract high-level and in detail at the connection adapter levels. My code
            is highly organized and I pride myself in working smarter by keeping up to date in the changing landscape of both Ruby and Rails as the
            technologies move forward. My second love is the Prototype JavaScript framework and programming interactive glue in a fully object
            oriented way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SKILLS:</strong> Administrating UNIX operating systems in small to mid-size networks, with an emphasis on
            OSX client/server. Experience in managing Rails applications in production environments utilizing Apache/Mongrel/Capistrano. System
            Administration skills includes managing postfix/cyrus mail, open directory, split horizon DNS, MySQL, firewalls, and virtual private
            networks. I am also familiar with configuring Cisco and Extreme Networks routers/switches.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>TOOLS OF THE TRADE:</strong> A Mac with TextMate and a terminal. In detail, for application development, I prefer to build a full
            stack that mimics as closely as possible any production environment I will be deploying to. Typically this involves using MacPorts to
            install my own Apache2, MySQL, Ruby, Git/Subversion, SQLite3, FreeTDS/ODBC/DBI, OpenSSL, Libxml, ImageMagick, etc. I am a proficient in
            the Unix shell, and recently have moved to ZSH. On the creative side, my previous design experience has kept me strong in the usage of
            PhotoShop/Illustrator for doing my own site designs and/or splicing other's designs into hand coded XHTML/CSS to match pixel for pixel. I
            am equally proficient with Subversion and Git alike. I prefer to work with Git and local topic branches and if necessary, I have
            extensive experience with git-svn.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PEOPLE SKILLS:</strong> I love to work with talented people. Even more I love to teach and help others learn about the things I
            love to do. I am currently the organizer for the <a href="http://757rb.org/">Hampton Roads Ruby User's Group (757.rb)</a> where I give
            talks each and every month. Teaching others and writing articles is not only enjoyable, but helps me stay current.

              Joined a small development team and assumed lead developer for 2 core Rails applications actively being ported from Java to Ruby.
              Redesigned and wrote the whole presentation layer for both applications, which now also includes custom AJAX LinkRenders for
              WillPaginate. Ported components from Java/Struts to Ruby/Rails while rewriting SQL Server stored procedures to ruby class/instance
              methods. Champion and developed unit/functional testing processes in both applications. This included writing low level SQL Server rake
              tasks which tunneled commands via SSH to window boxes for cloning schemas, and replicating stored procedures for test databases to
              rewriting both applications authentication systems to idiomatic rails libraries that include test helpers for functional testing while
              still maintaining backward compatibility to SSO services for legacy Java components. Create and maintain numerous libraries/plugins
              that extend the rails framework for the business model. These happen at almost every component to the framework but I specialize in
              ActiveRecord plugins to support legacy schemas and multi platform systems. Wrote all PDF::Writer generator classes that abstract out
              typical verbose PDF::Writer code to a friendlier interface.

              As the sole developer created a greenfield rails eCommerce application tailored for the consumer coupon industry. Due to the unique
              nature of the digital goods, virtual inventorying and security, the entire application included strict business rules on the monthly
              inventory per retailer campaign that had timeout hooks in the front end shopping cart. Digital goods were compiled and delivered via a
              custom Java application per transaction that created serialized coupons with barcodes for that specific transaction by the central
              rails application. Made extensive use of ImageMagick and the GNU Barcode ruby wrappers. Developed payment processing utilizing both the
              direct and express checkout methods of PayPal's NVP API. This app never made it to public view and most details are still patent
              pending. Built a community marketing site for the company's upcoming trading card game (TCG) called FightKlub. The majority of my
              involvement for this application involved developing customizations to Mephisto/Beast and deploying them into production. These sites
              can be currently found at <a href="http://www.decipher.com/">decipher.com</a> and include Prototype animations, custom liquid
              templates, and core extensions to Beast to register new founding mentors.

              Moved entire company from Microsoft ActiveDirectory/Exchange services to Apple XServes using OpenDirectory/Postfix/Cyrus. Also moved
              all non legacy .Net applications and websites to those existing XServes. Troubleshooted critical routing errors by predecessors and
              firewall configurations which also involved setting up new gigabit Cisco equipment to maintain companies DMZ and existing VLANs to
              offsite warehouses.
