            Summary
          </h2>
          <p>
            Software developer that loves problem solving using Ruby, JavaScript (CoffeeScript) or Objective-C. Previous careers in ops, marketing
            and <a href="/2011/09/11/revisiting-my-design-past/">design</a> combine to add value at all levels. I take ownership of my tasks, have a
            strong work ethic, and require no hand holding. So whether it is a low level database stack or a high level user interface design, I am
            right at home.

            Highlights of Qualifications
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>PROGRAMMING SKILLS:</strong> Authored and collaborated on numerous open source projects in all these languages. To date, I have
            been programming web applications using Ruby and JavaScript for 7 years. My HTML/CSS skills far exceed most programmers since I have been
            developing web sites for 16 years and have been doing semantic and unobtrusive presentation layer CSS for 8 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>TOOLS OF THE TRADE:</strong> UNIX is my integrated development environment, specifically a Mac using ZSH shell with TextMate. I
            currently use rbenv and pow for my local development stack with a backend of MacPorts for anything else. Yes, MacPorts! I happen to like
            the /opt sandbox concept which keeps Apple's OS upgrades from hosing my dynamically linked dependencies. Git is the only SCM I like, but
            I have experience in many others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PEOPLE SKILLS:</strong> I love to work with talented people! Even more so, I like to teach and help others learn about the things
            I myself love to do. I am currently the organizer for the <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/130/">Hampton Roads Ruby User's Group
            (757.rb)</a> where I give talks each and every month. Teaching others and writing articles is not only enjoyable, but helps me stay
            current with my craft.

              <a href="http://homemarks.com/">HomeMarks</a> is a AJAX start page geared towards todo or project-based bookmarking. The idea is a
              throwback to the HTML start pages we developers made for ourselves going back to 1996. I use HomeMarks as a way of staying on top of
              Rails best practices by rewriting much of it every few years. About 4 years ago I wrote v2.0 by building my own <a href=
              "http://bit.ly/w0ljee">MVC JavaScript framework</a> and moving the Rails application to follow a <a href="http://bit.ly/hJYfNA">service
              oriented design</a>. This put me years ahead of frameworks such as Backbone.js or SproutCore. Shortly afterward, I build my first
              <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/homemarks">iPhone application</a> using HomeMarks new service layer and I have subsequently given talks
              to local and distant groups on how to integrate RESTful Rails applications with iOS' Core Data framework. I am currently writing v3.0
              with an emphasis on Spine.JS and CoffeeScript on top of an HTML5/CSS3 web layer that utilizes Sass &amp; Compass CSS framework and my
              own hand coded CSS animations and transitions.

              As the sole developer created a multi-tenant Rails eCommerce application tailored for the coupon industry. Due to the unique nature of
              the digital goods, virtual inventorying and security, the entire application included strict business rules on the monthly inventory
              per retailer campaign that had timeout hooks in the front end shopping cart. Digital goods were compiled and delivered via a custom
              Java application per transaction that created serialized coupons with barcodes for that specific transaction by the central Rails
              application. Made extensive use of ImageMagick and the GNU Barcode Ruby wrappers. Developed payment processing utilizing both the
              direct and express checkout methods of PayPal's NVP API.

              currently found at <a href="http://www.decipher.com/">decipher.com</a> and include Prototype animations, custom liquid templates, and

              Working with the head of Product Development, I was awarded a contract with NetSurfer to provide consulting and development for its
              Macintosh software distribution method. While partially on-site in Atlanta, Georgia, the product was built, tested, and integrated into
              the CD Surfer Kit for distribution to InfiNet and all of their affiliate newspapers.

              Honed previous design, typography &amp; layout experience in a full-service boutique agency during the cusp of the digital media age.
              This allowed me to gain invaluable knowledge and skills in the mechanics of traditional design/layout while using the earliest computer
              applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Worked with exciting local industries and brands such as the logo/collateral design for ABNB Credit Union, package design for Kettler
              International, and Womble Realty. Streamlined operations and developed efficiencies in workflow for many of these clients including
              re-writing sales and development specs for Bell Atlantics Yellow Pages ad production.

            <p>
              Created a new line-of-business for Internet Marketing at the onset of the development of other new-media companies. This was done by
              strengthening an existing client relationship in the Travel-Tourism/Hospitality vertical of the business. I was responsible for hiring
              and training new staff for this market.
