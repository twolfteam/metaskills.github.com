      Summary
    </h2>
    <p>
      Software developer that loves problem solving using Ruby, JavaScript (CoffeeScript) or Objective-C. Previous careers in ops, marketing and
      <a href="/2011/09/11/revisiting-my-design-past/">design</a> combine to add value at all levels. I take ownership of my tasks, have a strong
      work ethic, and require no hand holding. So whether it is a low level database stack or a high level user interface design, I am right at home.

    <h2>
      Highlights of Qualifications
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>PROGRAMMING SKILLS:</strong> Authored and collaborated on numerous open source projects in all these languages. To date, I have been
      programming web applications using Ruby and JavaScript for {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2005 }} years. My HTML/CSS skills far exceed most
      programmers since I have been developing web sites for {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:1996 }} years and have been doing semantic and
      unobtrusive presentation layer CSS for {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2004 }} years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>TOOLS OF THE TRADE:</strong> UNIX is my integrated development environment, specifically a Mac using ZSH shell with Sublime Text 2. I
      currently use rbenv and pow for my local development stack with a back-end of MacPorts for anything else. Yes, MacPorts! I happen to like the
      /opt sandbox concept which keeps Apple's OS upgrades from hosing my dynamically linked dependencies. Git is the only SCM I like, but I have
      experience in many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>PEOPLE SKILLS:</strong> I love to work with talented people! Even more so, I like to teach and help others learn about the things I
      myself love to do. I am currently the organizer for the <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/130/">Hampton Roads Ruby User's Group (757.rb)</a>
      where I give talks each and every month. Teaching others and writing articles is not only enjoyable, but helps me stay current with my craft.

        Implemented some basic steps to moving the organization to a more service oriented design by defining API layers, single sign on solutions,
        and development setups. Built internal tools for their pharmacist call queue using Spine.JS that heavily leveraged WebSockets and Server Send
        Events to keep all clients synchronized. The JavaScript application was developed on top of a new Rails application back-end along with a
        Ruby client gem that opened up APIs for this new service to legacy RoR applications.

        <a href="http://homemarks.com/">HomeMarks</a> is a AJAX start page geared towards todo or project-based bookmarking. The idea is a throwback
        to the HTML start pages we developers made for ourselves going back to 1996. I use HomeMarks as a way of staying on top of Rails best
        practices by rewriting much of it every few years. About {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2008 }} years ago I wrote v2.0 by building my own
        <a href="http://bit.ly/w0ljee">MVC JavaScript framework</a> and moving the Rails application to follow a <a href=
        "http://bit.ly/hJYfNA">service oriented design</a>. This put me years ahead of frameworks such as Backbone.js or SproutCore. Shortly
        afterward, I build my first <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/homemarks">iPhone application</a> using HomeMarks new service layer and I have
        subsequently given talks to local and distant groups on how to integrate RESTful Rails applications with iOS' Core Data framework. I am
        currently writing v3.0 with an emphasis on Spine.JS and CoffeeScript on top of an HTML5/CSS3 web layer that utilizes Sass &amp; Compass CSS
        framework and my own hand coded CSS animations and transitions.

        As the sole developer created a multi-tenant Rails eCommerce application tailored for the coupon industry. Due to the unique nature of the
        digital goods, virtual inventorying and security, the entire application included strict business rules on the monthly inventory per retailer
        campaign that had timeout hooks in the front end shopping cart. Digital goods were compiled and delivered via a custom Java application per
        transaction that created serialized coupons with barcodes for that specific transaction by the central Rails application. Made extensive use
        of ImageMagick and the GNU Barcode Ruby wrappers. Developed payment processing utilizing both the direct and express checkout methods of
        PayPal's NVP API.
