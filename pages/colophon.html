      <span class="photofancy floatr mb10 ml20"><img src="/assets/resume/photo.jpg" alt="Ken Collins" width="250" height="250"></span> My name is Ken
      Collins and the concept for my blog reflects a big theme in my work ethic, working smarter not harder. The best way to accomplish that is to
      build tools. Poor programmers complain about their tools, good ones build tools to do the work for them. Since I am a problem solver and tool
      builder by nature, the term MetaSkills which is a play on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_programming" title=
      "What is Meta Programming?">meta programming</a> seemed to best describe me.

    <h2>
      My History
    </h2>
    <p>
      Long before I became a full time software developer, my career had started in the world of design and marketing. It happened in 9th grade when
      I submitted a report in history class that got an A+ simply for the fact that it was presented well. I did have an advantage beyond my personal
      World Book Encyclopedias. I was likely the first kid in 1986 to wield a $5,000 laser printer at home. I also worked at a local print shop and
      my Mac Plus consistently outperformed the <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=1052" title=
      "Go to the museum!">Xerox 6085 Workstations</a> that I worked on. That's right, at the age of 14 I was being paid as a Desktop Publishing
      computer operator. Back then, a 10 megabyte hard drive was elite and the fastest way to rotate text was to stand on your head. My have the
      times changed! To learn more about my job history, <a href="/pages/resume.html" title="Ken Collins' Resume">go check out my resume</a>. Sorry,
      you will not find the print shop nor my paper route on there :)

    <h2>
      How Has This Happened?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have been blogging for {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2005 }} years and throughout those years, the technology stack has changed a lot. My
      blog started in 2005 when I decided to turn my home office into a <a href="/2006/02/05/mini-network-with-a-big-xserve-style/">Mac Mini Colo</a>
      facility. Back then my blog was running under Drupal. As I started to do more Ruby work, it eventually <a href=
      "/2008/03/22/metaskills-net-reborn-on-mephisto/">moved to Mephisto</a>. Here lately, I <a href=
      "/2010/12/27/let-it-go-moving-from-mephisto-to-jekyll/">moved to Jekyll</a>, a ruby-based static site generator. Blogging is fun and can help
      you remember the things you love to do while sharing with others. I highly recommend it. Besides, watching page view counts on Google Analytics
      is fun!
