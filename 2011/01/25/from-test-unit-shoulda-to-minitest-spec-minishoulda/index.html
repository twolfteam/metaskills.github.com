          <p>
            It seems the MiniTest replacement for Test::Unit in Ruby 1.9 has been presenting itself more and more in my daily readings. Recently was
            Jamis Buck's article titled <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2742-the-road-to-faster-tests">The road to faster tests</a> where he
            talks about optimizing basecamp's suite to run faster. And there again, some of the comments below mentioned MiniTest as a solution. That
            got me thinking on what would it take for me to switch from Test::Unit to MiniTest.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love testing! But I am not nuts about large libraries. Looking at you RSpec! <a href=
            "http://evan.tiggerpalace.com/articles/2010/12/18/ruby-test-unit-sucks-and-why-i-still-use-it/">Like others</a>, I believe that you do
            not need a bloated test framework to get good coverage with a lean and succinct style. A handful of assertions and a simple context
            structure provided by libraries like <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">Shoulda</a> is really all I need for both unit and a
            certain level of functional testing. It is my firm believe that large libraries and semi-magical test code based on things like RSpec
            will wane in the coming years. Those that base very large test suites on them will suffer the penalty for when an upgrade or test
            refactor is needed. I could be wrong, time will tell. For now let's cover how to move to MiniTest for those that like simple Test::Unit
            and or Shoulda.
          </p>
          <p>
            MiniTest provides a drop in replacement for Test::Unit, so I wont cover the details of those basics. What most do not know is that
            MiniTest comes with a simple MiniTest::Spec DSL that uses <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> blocks much like Shoulda's
            <code>context</code> and <code>should</code> methods. The similarities were so close that I set out to move all my projects to
            MiniTest::Spec. The goal would be that none of my exiting suites context/should/before/after code would require a change. The result...

          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/metaskills/mini_shoulda">MiniShoulda</a> is a small ruby gem that puts a Shoulda DSL on top of
            MiniTest::Spec. All it really does it alias a few key methods. Here is the core of it now.

            For now, MiniShoulda performs only one monkey patch to MiniTest. There is a critical bug in MiniTest that does not allow the
            describe/context blocks to use the existing scope of the parent class. I have a <a href=
            "https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/pull/9">pull request</a> in for the project. Please help out and add a thoughtful comment based on
            the <a href="https://github.com/metaskills/minitest/commit/e7cde5bd9e61bc1ac13c7326ef4de23382e3467b">merits of the patch</a> and the

            Our gem spec will automatically pull in MiniTest version 2.0.2 or greater. Assuming you have a test helper file, the top requires will
            looks something like this. MiniTest needs that autorun file required or none of your tests will run.

            What should I expect? For starters, expect a few of your tests to fail. Especially ones that were happenstantially running linearly and
            not exercised in isolation. I think there is a technical term for this? Anyways, MiniTest mixes up the test suite each run trough it
            using a random seed. So it is highly like to expose a few poorly written tests that depended on state leftover from a previous test. Also
            the MiniTest::Unit underneath MiniTest::Spec does not have a few assertions you may have used. One is <code>assert_raise</code> which is
            now the standard convention <code>assert_raises</code> with an "s". And finally <code>assert_nothing_raised</code> has been pulled
            completely since Test::Unit's documentation alluded to its uselessness for a long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            What does MiniTest::Spec give you besides clean and powerful describe/it organization with before/after setups and teardowns? I highly
            recommend the <a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/minitest/1">MiniTest cheat sheet</a> to find out. See the spec and mock methods at
            the bottom? As much as I have always like the basic unit testing assertions, I am looking forward to using the must/wont object
            assertions.
