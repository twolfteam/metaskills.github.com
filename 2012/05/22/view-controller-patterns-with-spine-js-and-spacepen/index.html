            The VC in 'MVC'
          </h2>
          <p>
            As Addy Osmani points out in his <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/addyosmani/p/scaling-your-javascript-applications">Scaling Your
            JavaScript Applications</a> presentation, all JavaScript 'MVC' frameworks interpret MVC differently. These differences are an academic
            rabbit hole and if you are really interested about them, I recommend reading some of the resource links at the bottom of this post. One
            in particular by Jonas Nicklas really outlined how I think client side JavaScript applications should be developed. It is titled <a href=
            "http://elabs.se/blog/33-why-serenade-js">Why Serenade.js</a> and in it, Jonas describes his reasons for yet another JavaScript MVC
            framework. In doing so, he outlines the responsibilities of the MVC triad as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Views:</strong> Present data from the model and update it if it changes, notify controllers of user interaction events.
            <strong>Controllers:</strong> React to user interaction events by instructing the model to perform certain actions.
            <strong>Models:</strong> Handle business logic and persistence, notify the view of any changes to the data.
          </p>
          <p>
             Seems straight forward right? In actuality it is easy to stray from and there is a lot of wiggle room for both the MV* framework authors
            and their developers to re-interpret one or all of these components. The two that I think are most open for debate are the View and the
            Controller stacks. For example, how many <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/">JavaScript frameworks</a> do you know allow you
            to choose your own view framework? How many times have you heard too that views should be "logic-less" and how does each of these play
            into helping newcomers understand the proper way to code these precious views and controllers together? My answer, ask Apple!
          </p>
          <h2>
            Apple's View Controller Programming Guide
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some might be surprised that JavaScript applications for the browser can and should be coded much like modern desktop applications.
            Having developed iOS applications before, many of the same MVC principals and application structure apply. Apple has tons of
            documentation about general application design and one of my favorites is their <a href=
            "http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/Introduction/Introduction.html">View Controller
            Programming Guide</a>. I highly recommend anyone developing MVC JavaScript applications to read this guide. I'll paraphrase a few points:
          </p>
          <blockquote style="margin-left: 95px; margin-right: 95px;">
            A view controller manages a discrete portion of your appâ€™s user interface. Often that view is the root view for a more complex hierarchy
            of other views. View controllers typically fall in one of two categories, either content or container. Content view controllers are great
            for things like lists and images. Container view controllers coordinate with other view controllers like tab view controllers or
            navigation controllers.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            It is also worth reading both the <a href=
            "https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIViewController_Class/Reference/Reference.html">UIViewController</a>
            and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/uiview_class/UIView/UIView.html">UIView</a> class
            references too. So what should be your major take away from reading those? The first is that every controller in your JavaScript
            application manages a view. That view is going to be a DOM node that will most likely have a complex hierarchy of other views possibly
            managed by other controllers which themselves champion a node with a specific application concern. Second is that views are themselves
            valid objects built by classes with their own methods. It's best to think of UIViews as an instance of a jQuery object. Views should not
            be dumb either. They sometimes have handles back to model objects so they can establish bindings for updates. Views can also expose an
            interface that canonize how controllers should work with them and most often will have helper methods that break up their complexity. All
            of this is a good thing. If you disagree, stop reading now!

          <h2>
            SpacePen - Markup On The Final Frontier
          </h2>
          <p>
            I found the <a href="https://github.com/nathansobo/space-pen">SpacePen project on github</a> a few months ago and I have never looked at
            another templating solution since. For the first time my JavaScript application's view and controller stacks feel natural. No longer do I
            find myself writing any view related code in my controllers. SpacePen allows me to write view objects that encapsulate their concerns,
            stay DRY and build Spine.JS web applications that hit the MVC mark. So what is SpacePen? Basically a CoffeeScript subclass of a jQuery
            object.
          </p>
          <p>
            This simple example shows how your SpacePen view class defines its markup in a <code>@content</code> class function. This function yields
            a builder syntax where you can easily add attributes and values. My advice is to do basic structure only in your <code>@content</code>
            function and rarely take advantage of the fact that it also takes the same parameters argument passed to your constructor. I will explain
            more on that advice later. But first, I did say that views should expose interfaces to controllers and are first class code citizens that
            champion their own concerns right? Let's look at a common pattern, views building new nodes within itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The example has been changed slightly so that the view now exposes a public function called <code>addShip()</code> which takes an object
            to add to the view. It can easily implement this because I have declared the ordered list to be an outlet called <code>shipList</code>
            which will automatically be assigned as a property on each view instance. Calling append on that node is possible because like the view
            object itself, any outlet is a jQuery object as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though contrived, this example illustrates a powerful technique. If the view was refactored to some other structure besides an ordered
            list with items, the controller interface would stay the same. Pulling the thread, it is easy to see how a complex view hierarchy could
            have views building and managing messages to their subviews too. This is the crux of my article, but first, lets talk about controllers.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Spine.JS Controllers
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spine.JS is my goto JavaScript MVC framework and if you are unfamiliar with it, check out their <a href=
            "http://spinejs.com/docs/introduction">introduction</a> or read <a href="http://destroytoday.com/blog/reasons-for-spinejs/">why
            others</a> have chosen to use it. The main reasons I love Spine.JS can be summed up like so. First, it is authored in CoffeeScript, which
            means I can read the code to learn it. Second, all model instances will reflect changes by any other instance. Lastly, the controllers
            are minimally implemented and nicely abstract managing a view and the way controllers respond to events that bubble up to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Spine.JS controller always has an element associated to it which can be accessed via the <code>el</code> property. This element
            represents the view that controller manages. It will either be created for you or it can be assigned via the constructor. Many patterns
            in Spine.JS rely on appending elements to a controller and most of the functions for adding these subviews either take an element or an
            object that has an <code>el</code> property. This means building complex view/controller hierarchies by stacking Spine.JS controllers is
            both idiomatic and almost identical to how iOS view controllers work.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Using SpacePen Views With Spine.JS Controllers
          </h2>
          <p>
            With the overview of these components out of the way, let's jump right into how they can work together to punch the VC up a notch in your
            next JavaScript MVC application. These examples below are pared down version of a scheduler application I just completed. The model is
            similar to an iCal day interface for calendar events. In such, there would be a view controller that manages the presentation of your
            schedule "by day". This controller's view would have a header for the current day and a set of controls for going to the previous day,
            today and the next day. This controller would act as a navigation controller and correlate to Apple's notion of a "container" view
            controller. When needed, it would find or create a day controller and append it to one of its subviews. The code for that container
            controller and view is out of the scope of this article, but its one of many day "content" controllers and view are perfect examples.
            Here we go!
          </p>
          <p>
            So rule number one, always create an instance of a SpacePen view and assign that to the <code>@view</code> property of every Spine.JS
            controller. That <code>@view</code> will be assigned to the controller's <code>@el</code> property when it supers up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rule number two, keep the <code>@content</code> function for your views concerned with building the structure only. In my example, I set
            the date for the event using the <code>initialize</code> hook provided by SpacePen. This rule is important when you want to bind views to
            model events and update that view accordingly. All customization of the view to a model object should be done in a set/update helper of
            that view.
          </p>
          <h2>
            In Greater Detail
          </h2>
          <p>
            Here is the same controller and view example with a bit more detail. First up, the view. This day view CoffeeScript file has a public
            <code>App.Views.Day</code> view and a private <code>EventView</code> that represents a subview and would be bound to a model instance.
            This public day view exposes a few public functions for a controller to hook into. The <code>addEvent</code> function will actually build
            a new SpacePen views for the passed model and append it as a subview. Notice too the <code>findEvent</code> helper function which can
            find the DOM element for a model object and then use the <code>view()</code> function provided by SpacePen to get to the SpacePen
            instance for this node.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next up, the expanded day controller example that manages the view above. In this example we bind to two of the the Spine.JS
            <code>CalendarEvent</code> model events. One for update and one for destroy. These events are then pushed down to the view and will do
            any work necessary. Just in case this controller is ever discarded for performance reasons, we hook into the <code>release()</code>
            function provided by Spine.JS controllers to remove the event listeners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hope you found this mini introduction to SpacePen and Spine.JS controllers useful. There is literally tons of ways you can use these
            tools together to make your controllers and views fun to build and maintainable. Be excellent and let me know what works for you!
