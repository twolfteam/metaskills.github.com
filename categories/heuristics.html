              When ActiveRecord 3.2 was released there was a small addition called ActiveRecord::Store which bills itself as a simple key/value store
              for your models. The code below is pulled right from their example usage. class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base store :settings,
              accessors: [:color, :homepage] end @user = User.new(color: &#39;black&#39;, homepage: &#39;37signals.com&#39;) @user.color # =&gt;

              One part of Objective-C that I like is being able to send messages to nil objects safely and more so their KVC and KVO patterns. In
              Ruby I often use the #try method to safely send messages to objects that may be nil at runtime. But one thing I always wanted was a
              nice way to send a key path, basically a string of methods signatures, to an object in the same way. I give you my simple #try_keypath

              Last week I had the pleasure of rewriting 4 years of legacy PDF::Writer code to PDFKit. Why? Well drawing pdfs in ruby using libraries
              like PDF::Writer is like composing a webpage with an Etch A Sketch. In short, its a damn chore that involves a bunch of code that mixes
              both data and presentation. Sure there are gems like Prawn that make this much easier, but nothing beats drawing your pdf code in
              native HTML and CSS, and that is...

              Rake is cool. It is built so that multiple tasks with the same name run in a reverse defined series. This is great, but sometimes you
              want to override a task with your own behavior and conditionally call the earlier task. Especially if that task is defined deep
              somewhere else, like in a rails gem. I have had to solve this problem before in Rake. Awhile back I hacked something up that would
              totally trump a predefined rake task and...

              Earlier this week I gave a talk at our local ruby users group, 757.rb, about Memcached. Here recently I started picking it up again so
              that I could keep track of large sets of PK/FK changes during a big database move. In doing so, I decided to dig deep into it's
              internals and get a better grasp of how I would use it when I decided to do some serious fragment caching again. The biggest thing I

              developing a service-oriented application (SOA) since I have moved all client-side coupling from the controllers, like RJS, and only
              respond with HEAD or JSON data. Today I learned about Halcyon which is self described as a JSON web application framework built on

              Well this is working out well so far. I'm really liking the Passenger (mod_rails for Apache) extension. Right now I have this Mephisto
              site running it and it seems to be doing really well. Also, most people do not do this, but I run a full development stack
              Apache/MongrelCluster to mimic production boxes the best way I can. Now I am running mod_rails on all my development hosts. Some Things

              Here is how to get a playlist of sounds that will be hooked to both your autotest :red and :green callbacks. Basically this gives you a
              folder of sounds that are played one after another, in a loop, as your tests pass or fail. See this move below for a quick example.
              Step 1: Install QTPlay from MacPorts $ sudo port install qtplay Step 2: Download My Autotest Playlist Files $ cd ~ $ curl -O

              I just had an issue pop up today that seemed to be an issue for a few others. It seemed that all of a sudden that my autotest was stuck
              in an infinite loop after a failure or error. At first I thought it was related to some additions to my ~/.autotest file but after
              commenting out the whole lot of additions there, I realized it was something else. Here was my fix. Basically I think these errors are
              always...

              OK, so you want to keep your code placement REALLY organized. You have read about my persnicketyness and now you want to practice the
              best in concern placement and keep those controllers of yours really slim. Like me, you may want to try and keep controller feature
              additions to very specific one liners of code. Organizing your controller code to do just that with ActiveRecord models or even your
              own custom classes is a pretty easy task, but how do...

              Well after a year of neglect, the MetaSkills.net blog has been reborn on Mephisto. Previously I was using Drupal and it finally got to
              a point where I was so deep into ruby that I did not even have the gumption to open up a PHP session to publish anything. The sad part
              is that I told myself that this PHP disdain would help me get off my butt and move to Mephisto. You know, eat my own dog food...

              I've been learning to or &quot;trying to learn&quot; Ruby on Rails for a few months now and things have always kept me from finishing
              the book that I purchased from those great publishers at the pragmatic bookshelf. My problem has been that sometimes other work has
              gotten in the way, but mostly it was because I did not have the core understanding of the basics for building web applications.

              If you are like me, an up and coming network geek, you probably thought that browsers automatically cached a site's assets and media as
              you went through it and looked at each page. I was very surprised to find out that this was not the case. In fact, every time I went
              from page to page on my newly created MetaSkills.net blog all of the CSS, PNG, JavaScript and other media files that were common to
              those pages were being...

              Or, how to be the biggest network geek you can in only 1 square foot of space. Starting last year after reading Ward Mundy's How-To
              Bonanza, I knew I needed to use the Mac Mini as the core hardware component for my home network. Mostly because it looks good and small
              form fits easily on my desk. Good as that might be, the Mac Minis do have drawbacks and, if you're serious about your hosting choices,

              Lately, I've been loving all things that can be solved by using RsyncX. It's my de facto backup utility and I just keep finding more
              and more tasks for it as each day goes by. It has become the hammer for all my system's needs. So when it came time for me to implement
              a nice little backup routine for the MySQL databases hosted here at ActionMoniker.com, it was the first tool I considered. My
              requirements were simple, I needed...
