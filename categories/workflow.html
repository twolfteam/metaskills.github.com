              Rake is cool. It is built so that multiple tasks with the same name run in a reverse defined series. This is great, but sometimes you
              want to override a task with your own behavior and conditionally call the earlier task. Especially if that task is defined deep
              somewhere else, like in a rails gem. I have had to solve this problem before in Rake. Awhile back I hacked something up that would
              totally trump a predefined rake task and...

              Based on my previous article Using Autotest For Rails Plugin Development, Brennan Dunn wrote a ZSH function that helps him with his
              eager rails plugin work. Testing plugins is simply the most fun you will ever have. It's nice to test in isolation and easy to make a
              plugin test multiple rails versions, etc. Typically plugin testing is very fast to because you are not burdened with excessive tests in
              a big app that might use it. Just the ones...

              more time to extract some of my work to plugins, I really wanted autotest to come with me. The problem is that the default autotest
              mappings do not play with rails conventions, the biggest being that test files for a lib match the name of the lib with _test.rb at the

              It has been about 6 months now since I started using the Shoulda testing plugin as my BDD/TDD tool of choice. Unlike a lot of other
              people, I did not flock to the RSpec bandwaggon. Personally I think RSpec is horribly bloated a sledgehammer for a simple issue, the
              need to have test code organized with nested setups and context blocks. If you are new to Shoulda, I highly urge you to take a look at
              the Thoughbot project page...

              After attending Rails Edge in Reston, Virginia I decided to move some common tasks from my ~/.irbrc file and put them into Rake. I
              thought I would share a task that reads and writes the ActiveRecord schema table. Sometimes in migrations this is either good to know
              or manually change. Simply copy this in a foo.task file in your project/lib/tasks directory and use rake -T to see the description and
              usage. I have placed these tasks in the db:version namespace....

              I made a revised version of a rake task that I have used quite often, for unloading existing DB tables into fixture data and thought I
              would share. This rake task is the in correct name space and adds a "rake db:fixtures:unload" command to your rails project when you
              put this in "lib/tasks/foo.rake". It can take an optional TABLES variable or if none is present the whole array of DB tables are
              converted. I find this rake task helpful when...
