              Our options for JavaScript MVC frameworks are numerous these days. While working on the third major rewrite of my personal bookmarking
              application, HomeMarks, I decided to learn Backbone.js. Thankfully a local friend of mine recommended that I try Spine.JS. I was
              immediately hooked! Why Spine.JS? Spine.JS is is authored in CoffeeScript and that is a big deal for me. I will never write raw
              JavaScript again, which I consider, the deprecated syntax. So a JavaScript MVC framework that is written...

              This weekend I decided to experiment with LESS CSS by replacing the existing Sass and Compass code that had been built thus far a small
              project. Why? Three basic reasons. First, I wanted to see how LESS stacked up. Second, I was intrigued by some of LESS' features, in
              particular their namespace support. Lastly, I wanted to use Twitter's Bootstrap project as a baseline for my design. Since Rails 3.1

              I ask this question a lot! To Job candidates, friends, and almost any developer that says they work with JavaScript. I believe how you
              encapsulate your JavaScript is a good indicator on your level of expertise with the language. I find that most beginners have come to
              JavaScript via jQuery and often define their functions at the top level namespace in some application.js file. These functions are
              loosely organized and often have no way of sharing simple object state and...

              Friends have told me that rich domain objects are seldom wielded when using jQuery to enhance behavior on web pages. I myself have
              always loved JavaScript as a rich dynamic language first and something for the DOM second. Hence most of my client-side JavaScript
              follows a robust object-oriented approach similar to Ruby. This is the main reason I have used Prototype.js for so long. Since Rails
              announced both jQuery and CoffeeScript as the defaults in version 3.1, I decided it...

              This twitter post by Dave Thomas sparked an interesting back and forth with DHH on how Rails 3.1 could be more opinionated towards web
              development for the browser. A short time before &ndash; it was announced that Rails would include CoffeeScript and Sass as defaults
              for JavaScript and CSS authoring. FWIW, both of these new defaults are in my opinion the best of the breed fore each task. If you have

              interactive console anytime we want. But with JavaScript, options are limited. Sure you could install Johnson/EnvJS, Rhino or some
              other JavaScript engine. Maybe even load up firebug or the web...

              A while back ago I wrote an article about how to use Rails built-in forgery protection in your RESTful AJAX calls. Normally AJAX
              requests, those responding true to request.xhr? in rails, are forgery whitelisted. But sometimes, and under what conditions I am not
              sure, AJAX methods are subjected to forgery protection. Maybe you have the ActionDispatch::Request#forgery_whitelisted? overridden to
              not include AJAX requests? Either way and for whatever reason â€“ if you like to use forgery protection in your RESTful AJAX...

              Writing the new HomeMarks has been a great exercise. I've learned that the AJAX Head Design Pattern Implementation is more akin to
              developing a service-oriented application (SOA) since I have moved all client-side coupling from the controllers, like RJS, and only
              respond with HEAD or JSON data. Today I learned about Halcyon which is self described as a JSON web application framework built on
              Rack. If you take a look at their example, it looks a lot like HomeMarks v2,...
