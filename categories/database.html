              Over the past few months I have been actively working with both Luis Lavena and Wayne E Seguin to incorporate both TinyTDS and the SQL
              Server Adapter into the latest release of the Rails Installer for Windows. Like them, I firmly believe that Ruby's success is tightly
              bound to how well we can bring these tools to the Windows platform. So despite that I have no love for the Windows â€“ I do want to see
              Ruby succeed and help...

              On December 1st, Heroku deprecated their bundles add-on in favor of their new PG Backups. Even though there are other solutions for
              automating backups using this new add-on, none of them met my needs. I like to have a daily DB backup history, just in case you find
              something bad that happened "n" days earlier. Below is a simple rake task suitable to place in your rails lib/tasks/heroku.task file.

              I just finished the first cut of learning C extensions for ruby and I present The TinyTds gem. It is meant to serve the extremely
              common use-case of connecting, querying and iterating over results to Microsoft SQL Server databases from ruby. Even though it uses
              FreeTDS's DB-Library, it is NOT meant to serve as direct 1:1 mapping of that complex C API The benefits are speed, automatic casting to
              ruby primitives, and proper encoding support. It converts all SQL Server...

              So that about sums up what I've been doing for the past 4 weeks. A total rewrite of the SQL Server Adapter for Rails. On top of passing
              all the Rails 2.2.2 tests, which is MAJOR news, it includes tons of new features. Unicode column support, pessimistic locking,
              date/time column casting, DDL transactions and way more. On top of that. It was nice being mentioned on the rubyonrails.org website not
              for my first, second, but a THIRD time. Thanks Gregg!...

              relationship over and over again. I'm sure the has_many association is by far the most common in app/db design. It gives a single

              I've been learning to or &quot;trying to learn&quot; Ruby on Rails for a few months now and things have always kept me from finishing
              the book that I purchased from those great publishers at the pragmatic bookshelf. My problem has been that sometimes other work has
              gotten in the way, but mostly it was because I did not have the core understanding of the basics for building web applications.

              and more tasks for it as each day goes by. It has become the hammer for all my system's needs. So when it came time for me to implement
              a nice little backup routine for the MySQL databases hosted here at ActionMoniker.com, it was the first tool I considered. My
