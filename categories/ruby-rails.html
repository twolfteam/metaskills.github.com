              working in Rails 3.1.0.rc4, but should be helpful to anybody. The good news is that most everything is wired up. First, you are going
              to need to update your Gemfile. Follow the latest conventions and make sure you have a :assets group. Use the example below. With the

              This twitter post by Dave Thomas sparked an interesting back and forth with DHH on how Rails 3.1 could be more opinionated towards web
              development for the browser. A short time before &ndash; it was announced that Rails would include CoffeeScript and Sass as defaults
              for JavaScript and CSS authoring. FWIW, both of these new defaults are in my opinion the best of the breed fore each task. If you have

              Over the past few months I have been actively working with both Luis Lavena and Wayne E Seguin to incorporate both TinyTDS and the SQL
              Server Adapter into the latest release of the Rails Installer for Windows. Like them, I firmly believe that Ruby's success is tightly
              bound to how well we can bring these tools to the Windows platform. So despite that I have no love for the Windows – I do want to see

              spec DSL. I introduce to you the MiniSpecUnit gem. MiniSpecUnit defines a Test::Unit::TestCase class that subclasses MiniTest::Spec. It
              implements only what is needed to make rails happy. It is not a drop in replacement for the real Test::Unit::TestCase that is included
              with ruby 1.9. Once you bundle the gem in your Rails application, it will satisfy...

              Last week I had the pleasure of rewriting 4 years of legacy PDF::Writer code to PDFKit. Why? Well drawing pdfs in ruby using libraries
              like PDF::Writer is like composing a webpage with an Etch A Sketch. In short, its a damn chore that involves a bunch of code that mixes
              both data and presentation. Sure there are gems like Prawn that make this much easier, but nothing beats drawing your pdf code in
              native HTML and CSS, and that is...

              For us at work, our uploads to campfire are really transitory. Most of the time they are simple screenshots around a current topic.
              Every now and then vacation photos or even movies, at the end of the day, none of it has value after a certain amount of time. To us as
              the real value of campfire is our textual transcripts. This morning after 4 years of campfire, we were real close to our 1GB limit of

              A few weeks ago I started looking into the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) project to help me build a better testing setup for both my day
              job and the ActiveRecord SQL Server Adapter. In a previous article I covered details of how to get a development stack up and running
              for Rails with SQL Server using MacPort's. This article will cover some new additions to that goal, but first and primarily, I wanted

              Sometime in rails 2.x the #inspect method for an ActiveRecord class was changed to show you all the column names (attributes) of that
              class. This is fine when things are small but if your working on a big legacy schema and you want clean terse debugging, all those
              column names can be noisy. I just set this initializer up today to kill it. Now the class just shows the number of columns. module

              Rake is cool. It is built so that multiple tasks with the same name run in a reverse defined series. This is great, but sometimes you
              want to override a task with your own behavior and conditionally call the earlier task. Especially if that task is defined deep
              somewhere else, like in a rails gem. I have had to solve this problem before in Rake. Awhile back I hacked something up that would

              installed. Ruby 1.9.1, the stable release, is just around the corner and if your like me, maybe you want to start playing around with
              it and perhaps test a few projects using 1.9 with edge rails 2.3. If so, and your on a Mac, then perhaps this installation method might

              So that about sums up what I've been doing for the past 4 weeks. A total rewrite of the SQL Server Adapter for Rails. On top of passing
              all the Rails 2.2.2 tests, which is MAJOR news, it includes tons of new features. Unicode column support, pessimistic locking,
              date/time column casting, DDL transactions and way more. On top of that. It was nice being mentioned on the rubyonrails.org website not
              for my first, second, but a THIRD time. Thanks Gregg!...

              Writing the new HomeMarks has been a great exercise. I've learned that the AJAX Head Design Pattern Implementation is more akin to
              developing a service-oriented application (SOA) since I have moved all client-side coupling from the controllers, like RJS, and only
              respond with HEAD or JSON data. Today I learned about Halcyon which is self described as a JSON web application framework built on
              Rack. If you take a look at their example, it looks a lot like HomeMarks v2,...

              It has been about 6 months now since I started using the Shoulda testing plugin as my BDD/TDD tool of choice. Unlike a lot of other
              people, I did not flock to the RSpec bandwaggon. Personally I think RSpec is horribly bloated a sledgehammer for a simple issue, the
              need to have test code organized with nested setups and context blocks. If you are new to Shoulda, I highly urge you to take a look at

              Here is how to get a playlist of sounds that will be hooked to both your autotest :red and :green callbacks. Basically this gives you a

              I just had an issue pop up today that seemed to be an issue for a few others. It seemed that all of a sudden that my autotest was stuck
              in an infinite loop after a failure or error. At first I thought it was related to some additions to my ~/.autotest file but after
              commenting out the whole lot of additions there, I realized it was something else. Here was my fix. Basically I think these errors are
              always...

              OK, so you want to keep your code placement REALLY organized. You have read about my persnicketyness and now you want to practice the
              best in concern placement and keep those controllers of yours really slim. Like me, you may want to try and keep controller feature
              additions to very specific one liners of code. Organizing your controller code to do just that with ActiveRecord models or even your
              own custom classes is a pretty easy task, but how do...

              One of the things that I have really grown persnickety about is the placement of code. For example, I am a huge advocate that
              controllers in a rails project should read like a mini Domain Specific Language (DSL) and that as much logic as possible be delegated
              to the models. In my opinion the best way to do that in a Rails project is to learn the proper usage of ActiveRecord Association
              Extensions. You can check out the Rails API...

              Well after a year of neglect, the MetaSkills.net blog has been reborn on Mephisto. Previously I was using Drupal and it finally got to
              a point where I was so deep into ruby that I did not even have the gumption to open up a PHP session to publish anything. The sad part
              is that I told myself that this PHP disdain would help me get off my butt and move to Mephisto. You know, eat my own dog food...

              After attending Rails Edge in Reston, Virginia I decided to move some common tasks from my ~/.irbrc file and put them into Rake. I
              thought I would share a task that reads and writes the ActiveRecord schema table. Sometimes in migrations this is either good to know
              or manually change. Simply copy this in a foo.task file in your project/lib/tasks directory and use rake -T to see the description and
              usage. I have placed these tasks in the db:version namespace....

              I made a revised version of a rake task that I have used quite often, for unloading existing DB tables into fixture data and thought I
              would share. This rake task is the in correct name space and adds a "rake db:fixtures:unload" command to your rails project when you
              put this in "lib/tasks/foo.rake". It can take an optional TABLES variable or if none is present the whole array of DB tables are
              converted. I find this rake task helpful when...

              the book that I purchased from those great publishers at the pragmatic bookshelf. My problem has been that sometimes other work has
              gotten in the way, but mostly it was because I did not have the core understanding of the basics for building web applications.
