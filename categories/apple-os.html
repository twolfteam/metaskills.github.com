              There are many great techniques for sharing code across XCode projects. If that code is tested and build-able by XCode as a static
              library, Clint Harris' Easy, Modular Code Sharing Across iPhone Apps: Static Libraries and Cross-Project References is really a solid
              source on the topic. However, this approach is a bit heavy handed for what I wanted to do. Basically if you just have some common
              header and implementation files that you want to use across multiple XCode projects,...

              A few weeks ago I started looking into the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) project to help me build a better testing setup for both my day
              job and the ActiveRecord SQL Server Adapter. In a previous article I covered details of how to get a development stack up and running
              for Rails with SQL Server using MacPort's. This article will cover some new additions to that goal, but first and primarily, I wanted

              Although I have never thought of this idea, it seems to have been a popular request for quite some time and after a public request, the
              author of QuickSilver stepped up to the challenge and...

              I have not been a black Mac owner since I got rid of my Lombard (aka the Bronze Keyboard) way back in 2001. Before that, I was the
              proud owner of a 3400c which was also black and one of the first PowerPC laptops offered from Apple. That PowerBook cost me close to
              $4,000 if memory serves and I swear some of the debt is still hanging around today! So after being with Apple for so long I have
              very...

              Tim Toady tells us that (There Is More Than One Way To Do It) and I am sure this is not the first and not likely the last blog post you

              you, do it this way. Gaining the experience of compiling your own software will help you down the road when it...

              Or, how to be the biggest network geek you can in only 1 square foot of space. Starting last year after reading Ward Mundy's How-To
              Bonanza, I knew I needed to use the Mac Mini as the core hardware component for my home network. Mostly because it looks good and small
              form fits easily on my desk. Good as that might be, the Mac Minis do have drawbacks and, if you're serious about your hosting choices,
              these do have to...

              After being exposed to using TextMate for all my normal text editing needs, I soon began to do more things than just simple GREP-based
              search and replace functions. I actually started to look at code more often. Within a few short months, I had gone away from my
              established norm of the happenstantial viewing of simple CSS, HTML and PlainText files to a ful-time lookey lou of languages such as
              Ruby, XML, PHP, SQL or any number of configuration files...

              About a year ago a fellow co-worker of mine was raving that I should learn VIM from the command line interface (CLI) so that I could
              use it for all my text editing needs. My co-worker at the time was (and probably still is) the Systems Administrator and Lead
              Application Developer for a company that sold cheap discount software. During my tenure there I served as the Marketing Manager and as
