            UPDATE: [10/18/2011] I now use Fog vs AWS::S3 with Paperclip. I have included a Fog specific example below.
          </aside>
          <p>
            Yea I know, I am probably the last person on earth that is just getting around to using <a href=
            "http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a>. To be honest, most of my file upload code was written way before Paperclip or
            even AttachementFu was ever conceived. And frankly, I do not do much social app coding on the side - so the need never came up. But that
            changed recently and I wanted a really really good way of leveraging AWS::S3 storage with the best local app security while maintaining
            tight control over the files.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the Paperclip wiki has a few links that already dealt with some ways of protecting your app's attachments. One mentions a method I
            totally love called security through obscurity. It uses a secure random token as part of the filename which combined with the original
            filename and the id partition makes for great random URLs. The other is a great walk thru on how to use the :url option of paperclip to
            point access control back to your own application for your normal biz logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem I see with both of these methods is that they do not allow you to maintain app control past the final URL handoff/redirect.
            It also requires that your S3 bucket is public. For instance, if you were to use the <code>s3_permissions =&gt; :private</code> option of
            Paperclip, then that URL given to you by Paperclip is pretty much worthless. I knew AWS::S3 had authenticated GETs that generated an
            automatically expiring URL, but saw no way of accessing its features using the abstract <code>Paperclip::Attachment</code> object. So
            this is what I did.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me walk you thru some of the highlights of that class, the general concept following is that we are going to use the best of both
            examples in security mentioned above. First, the secure token, that is what #set_random_secret will generate for each instance. The
            <code>:path</code> option for Paperclip uses a proc to make sure each instance uses that attribute in the string that will be later
            interpolated further down. You can also see how I use the id partition too. Next, I have added two public instance methods. The first is
            #attachment_url and it will need a bit of explaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently in Paperclip, if you use the :url option and your :storage is set to :s3, then it is ignored. This could totally be
            intentional. So in a typical setup where you want the file download running through your own access control, you wold have a :url option
            like this <code>:url =&gt; '/:class/:id/:filename'</code>. So this is what #attachment_url mimics, it simply gets around that shortcoming
            and points the download action back to your own controller. How that controller would work is beyond the scope of this article, see the
            resources section below for those links.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last example method is #authenticated_s3_get_url which dips right on down to the AWS::S3 library to get the URL for the object in the
            bucket. AWS::S3's doc mention that it will automatically generate a secure GET url that expires in 5 minutes. However in my example, you
            can see where I am changing that to 10 minutes and forcing the HTTPS protocol. This would be the URL that your own controller would do
            the final redirect to. This URL is for your private objects in your S3 bucket and will only work for the amount of time you want it too!
            Meaning your app stays in complete control. Putting it all together one more time...
          </p>
          <h2>
            What Is That Noop Processor
          </h2>
          <p>
            Good eye! Did you see that I have a processor called Noop in the has_attached_file declaration? The default processor in Paperclip is the
            Thumbnail processor, which no matter what calls the ImageMagick identify command to see if it can do something to the file. I did not
            want that or any processing, just simple attachments. So I created this simple processor that just straight returns the file object. I
            made a <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/issues/#issue/118">ticket on the Paperclip's issue page</a> that hopefully would
            allow a <code>:processors =&gt; false</code> option one day that would do this as well. So maybe one day it'll be a feature.
          </p>
          <h2>
            UPDATE: Fog Example
          </h2>
          <p>
            Here is an updated <code>#authenticated_s3_get_url</code> that I use with Fog as the backend storage for S3. This example illustrates 2
            things. First that the bucket is named as your CNAME record which is also enforced in the <code>:fog_host</code>. I do this so that I can
            generate URLs via Paperclip or Fog and always have my custom domain in place. When I gsub the "s3.amazonaws.com" out, I am left with just
            my CNAME domain/bucket name. Lastly, if you want to generate "https" URLs, use the <code>#get_https_url</code> method.
          </p>
