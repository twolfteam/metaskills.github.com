              First, a little bit of background. A while back ago I took a great deal of my personal time to try out Twitter's Bootstrap project for
              a Rails application of mine. This meant that I was willing to throw away some of the work I had done in Sass and rewrite it using LESS.
              No problem I thought, at first glance LESS and Sass look almost identical in functionality. So after some weeks of improving the
              toolchain for LESS with...

              Our options for JavaScript MVC frameworks are numerous these days. While working on the third major rewrite of my personal bookmarking
              application, HomeMarks, I decided to learn Backbone.js. Thankfully a local friend of mine recommended that I try Spine.JS. I was
              immediately hooked! Why Spine.JS? Spine.JS is is authored in CoffeeScript and that is a big deal for me. I will never write raw
              JavaScript again, which I consider, the deprecated syntax. So a JavaScript MVC framework that is written...

              This weekend I decided to experiment with LESS CSS by replacing the existing Sass and Compass code that had been built thus far a small
              project. Why? Three basic reasons. First, I wanted to see how LESS stacked up. Second, I was intrigued by some of LESS' features, in
              particular their namespace support. Lastly, I wanted to use Twitter's Bootstrap project as a baseline for my design. Since Rails 3.1
              has been out for some time, I was expecting the...

              One part of Objective-C that I like is being able to send messages to nil objects safely and more so their KVC and KVO patterns. In
              Ruby I often use the #try method to safely send messages to objects that may be nil at runtime. But one thing I always wanted was a
              nice way to send a key path, basically a string of methods signatures, to an object in the same way. I give you my simple #try_keypath

              I ask this question a lot! To Job candidates, friends, and almost any developer that says they work with JavaScript. I believe how you
              encapsulate your JavaScript is a good indicator on your level of expertise with the language. I find that most beginners have come to
              JavaScript via jQuery and often define their functions at the top level namespace in some application.js file. These functions are
              loosely organized and often have no way of sharing simple object state and...

              Friends have told me that rich domain objects are seldom wielded when using jQuery to enhance behavior on web pages. I myself have
              always loved JavaScript as a rich dynamic language first and something for the DOM second. Hence most of my client-side JavaScript
              follows a robust object-oriented approach similar to Ruby. This is the main reason I have used Prototype.js for so long. Since Rails
              announced both jQuery and CoffeeScript as the defaults in version 3.1, I decided it...

              This twitter post by Dave Thomas sparked an interesting back and forth with DHH on how Rails 3.1 could be more opinionated towards web
              development for the browser. A short time before &ndash; it was announced that Rails would include CoffeeScript and Sass as defaults
              for JavaScript and CSS authoring. FWIW, both of these new defaults are in my opinion the best of the breed fore each task. If you have
              not done so, I suggest taking a quick read...

              gem make it really easy to write JavaScript or CSS using any templating language you desire. The rails defaults are CoffeeScript and
              Sass. About the best collection of Sass framework files for easy cross-browser CSS authoring are packaged in the compass framework.
              Compass even has great documentation for using their Sass framework. But what if...
