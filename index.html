              So after a few blog post on the subject of MiniTest::Spec, I finally have a simple testing stack for Rails 3 that leverages MiniTest's
              spec DSL. I introduce to you the MiniSpecUnit gem. MiniSpecUnit defines a Test::Unit::TestCase class that subclasses MiniTest::Spec. It
              implements only what is needed to make rails happy. It is not a drop in replacement for the real Test::Unit::TestCase that is included
              with ruby 1.9. Once you bundle the gem in your Rails application, it will satisfy...

              Last week I had the pleasure of rewriting 4 years of legacy PDF::Writer code to PDFKit. Why? Well drawing pdfs in ruby using libraries
              like PDF::Writer is like composing a webpage with an Etch A Sketch. In short, its a damn chore that involves a bunch of code that mixes
              both data and presentation. Sure there are gems like Prawn that make this much easier, but nothing beats drawing your pdf code in
              native HTML and CSS, and that is...
