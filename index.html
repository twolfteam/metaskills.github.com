              Any good Ruby developer that tests time-dependent code has used the Timecop gem. Timecop provides dead simple time travel and freezing
              capabilities to Ruby's standard library. But what if you are working on a rich JavaScript application that is backed and tested by
              something like a Rails application and you want to alter the test browser's clock as well? The answer is pretty simple, but let's first

              Here are a few quick tips for the time zone aware Rails developer that finds themselves deep into JavaScript date objects. First, use
              the Moment.js JavaScrpt date library! Moment.js has a very rich API for parsing and working with times, very similiar to
              ActiveSupport's extensions. However, it does not have a solid way of moving times across zones. Especially if those zones may or may
              not observer daylight savings time (DST). Many JavaScript time zone libraries require a huge set...

              The VC in 'MVC' As Addy Osmani points out in his Scaling Your JavaScript Applications presentation, all JavaScript 'MVC' frameworks
              interpret MVC differently. These differences are an academic rabbit hole and if you are really interested about them, I recommend
              reading some of the resource links at the bottom of this post. One in particular by Jonas Nicklas really outlined how I think client
              side JavaScript applications should be developed. It is titled Why Serenade.js and in it, Jonas describes...

              When ActiveRecord 3.2 was released there was a small addition called ActiveRecord::Store which bills itself as a simple key/value store
              for your models. The code below is pulled right from their example usage. class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base store :settings,
              accessors: [:color, :homepage] end @user = User.new(color: &#39;black&#39;, homepage: &#39;37signals.com&#39;) @user.color # =&gt;

              So even in LESS v1.3 you are still screwed for doing metaprogramming and working with a real CSS preprocessor. That may change for LESS

              Our options for JavaScript MVC frameworks are numerous these days. While working on the third major rewrite of my personal bookmarking
              application, HomeMarks, I decided to learn Backbone.js. Thankfully a local friend of mine recommended that I try Spine.JS. I was
              immediately hooked! Why Spine.JS? Spine.JS is is authored in CoffeeScript and that is a big deal for me. I will never write raw
              JavaScript again, which I consider, the deprecated syntax. So a JavaScript MVC framework that is written...

              This weekend I decided to experiment with LESS CSS by replacing the existing Sass and Compass code that had been built thus far a small
              project. Why? Three basic reasons. First, I wanted to see how LESS stacked up. Second, I was intrigued by some of LESS' features, in
              particular their namespace support. Lastly, I wanted to use Twitter's Bootstrap project as a baseline for my design. Since Rails 3.1

              One part of Objective-C that I like is being able to send messages to nil objects safely and more so their KVC and KVO patterns. In
              Ruby I often use the #try method to safely send messages to objects that may be nil at runtime. But one thing I always wanted was a
              nice way to send a key path, basically a string of methods signatures, to an object in the same way. I give you my simple #try_keypath
