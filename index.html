              This is a simple update to my original article for using compass's .scss files with the asset pipeline. This assumes you had this setup
              working in Rails 3.1.0.rc4, but should be helpful to anybody. The good news is that most everything is wired up. First, you are going
              to need to update your Gemfile. Follow the latest conventions and make sure you have a :assets group. Use the example below. With the

              Friends have told me that rich domain objects are seldom wielded when using jQuery to enhance behavior on web pages. I myself have
              always loved JavaScript as a rich dynamic language first and something for the DOM second. Hence most of my client-side JavaScript
              follows a robust object-oriented approach similar to Ruby. This is the main reason I have used Prototype.js for so long. Since Rails
              announced both jQuery and CoffeeScript as the defaults in version 3.1, I decided it...

              This twitter post by Dave Thomas sparked an interesting back and forth with DHH on how Rails 3.1 could be more opinionated towards web
              development for the browser. A short time before &ndash; it was announced that Rails would include CoffeeScript and Sass as defaults
              for JavaScript and CSS authoring. FWIW, both of these new defaults are in my opinion the best of the breed fore each task. If you have
              not done so, I suggest taking a quick read...

              JavaScript or CSS using any templating language you desire. The rails defaults are CoffeeScript and Sass. About the best collection of
              Sass framework files for easy cross-browser CSS authoring are packaged in the compass framework. Compass even has great documentation

              Over the past few months I have been actively working with both Luis Lavena and Wayne E Seguin to incorporate both TinyTDS and the SQL
              Server Adapter into the latest release of the Rails Installer for Windows. Like them, I firmly believe that Ruby's success is tightly
              bound to how well we can bring these tools to the Windows platform. So despite that I have no love for the Windows â€“ I do want to see

              So after a few blog post on the subject of MiniTest::Spec, I finally have a simple testing stack for Rails 3 that leverages MiniTest's
              spec DSL. I introduce to you the MiniSpecUnit gem. MiniSpecUnit defines a Test::Unit::TestCase class that subclasses MiniTest::Spec. It
              implements only what is needed to make rails happy. It is not a drop in replacement for the real Test::Unit::TestCase that is included
              with ruby 1.9. Once you bundle the gem in your Rails application, it will satisfy...

              Last week I had the pleasure of rewriting 4 years of legacy PDF::Writer code to PDFKit. Why? Well drawing pdfs in ruby using libraries
              like PDF::Writer is like composing a webpage with an Etch A Sketch. In short, its a damn chore that involves a bunch of code that mixes
              both data and presentation. Sure there are gems like Prawn that make this much easier, but nothing beats drawing your pdf code in
              native HTML and CSS, and that is...
